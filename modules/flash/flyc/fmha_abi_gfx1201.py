"""Host side of the gfx1201 attention ABI: the wire spec, and marshalling to it.

Everything the *caller* has to get right, in one place. Four kernels now share
this ABI -- the forward and the three backward ones -- and before this module
existed each carried its own copy of all of it. That is not merely repetitive:
`VarlenBits` is a **wire encoding**, and three copies of a wire encoding are
three chances for it to drift while every test still passes, because each
kernel is validated against its own copy.

**Not `fmha_common_gfx1201.py`.** That module is device-side: it emits IR, and
its central constraint is what the AST rewriter will and will not do to a
module-level function. Nothing here emits IR. These are plain Python functions
that run on the host before a launch, turning torch tensors and Python
arguments into the scalars and pointers the kernel signature wants. The two
concerns fail differently and are read at different times.

The three functions that take a build knob as their first argument
(`resolve_window`, `dropout_args`, `varlen_args`) are the only ones that are
not pure. They were closures over the builder's `const_expr` state; making the
dependency an argument is what let them move, and it also makes visible which
host behaviour a knob reaches -- something the closure form hid.

    `cache` is the caller's `weakref.WeakKeyDictionary`, not a module-level one:
    four kernels share this function and a single dict keyed by launcher would
    work, but passing it keeps the lifetime obviously the caller's.

    `flyc.compile` caches internally (`JitFunction._mem_cache`, keyed on the
    full argument signature), so this is not about avoiding recompilation --
    it is about dispatch overhead, measured at **157 us per call** at
    (head_dim 64, N 512), where the whole call is 63 us with the cache and
    220 us without. The gap closes as the kernel grows.

    A `WeakKeyDictionary` rather than an `exe._cf` attribute: that attribute is
    not one FlyDSL defines, so writing it mutates a FlyDSL-owned object. Weak
    keys so an entry dies with its launcher instead of pinning one compiled
    artifact -- and the GPU code object it owns -- per configuration for the
