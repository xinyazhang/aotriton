"""``six``-style polyfill for FlyDSL helpers that are branch-local, not upstream.

The vendored gfx1201 kernel (see ``UPSTREAM.md``) is written against
``xinyazhang/sdpa-gfx1201-feature``, and that branch adds six small functions
to ``kernels/common/`` that a stock ``flydsl`` does not yet have --
``git diff $(git merge-base HEAD upstream/main) HEAD -- kernels/common/`` is
+121 lines across ``kernels/common/utils.py`` and the new
``kernels/common/mma/wmma_ops.py``.

This module is **authored**, not vendored: each function below prefers the
stock package's own definition when one exists, and only falls back to a
local copy of the branch body otherwise. So this module empties itself out,
function by function, as each helper lands upstream -- it is a bridge, not a
permanent home. See ``UPSTREAM.md`` for which FlyDSL commit each fallback was
copied from and which upstream merge should delete it.

*Polyfill*, not *shim* or *compat*: this repository's ``shim`` already means
something specific (the generated C++ dispatch layer), so reusing the word
here would mislead.
