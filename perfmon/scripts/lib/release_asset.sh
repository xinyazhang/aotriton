# Shared mechanics for pulling a release asset and installing the kernel
# images out of it. Source this from a build-<tag>.sh.
#
# WHAT IS SHARED AND WHAT IS NOT
#
# Downloading a URL and untarring it does not drift between releases, so it
# lives here. WHICH asset to ask for drifts a great deal, so it does not --
# each build-<tag>.sh names its own asset. Verified against the actual
# release pages:
#
#   0.9.2b, 0.10b   No SEPARATE images package. There is one jumbo tarball,
#                   aotriton-<tag>-manylinux_2_28_x86_64-rocm<ver>-shared.tar.gz,
#                   and the GPU images are inside it along with the runtime.
#   0.11b, 0.11.2b  aotriton-<tag>-images-amd-<group>.tar.gz, with gfx11xx as
#                   ONE group.
#   0.12.1b, 0.13b  same shape, but gfx11xx was split into gfx110x and gfx115x,
#                   and gfx1250 appeared. +asan variants also exist and must
#                   never be selected.
#
# EVERY released tarball has the same internal structure: aotriton/lib/*. The
# split at 0.11b did not change that -- it moved the aotriton/lib/aotriton.images
# hierarchy into its own package while aotriton/lib/libaotriton*.so stayed in the
# runtime one. So 0.9.2b/0.10b's -shared tarball carries both, and the newer
# images tarballs carry only the images, at the same path either way. That is
# why one extraction (strip the aotriton/lib/ prefix) serves both shapes, and
# why asking for the -shared tarball is the right move for the two releases
# that predate the split rather than a workaround.
#
# Note there is no git sha in any of these names -- an earlier version of this
# code matched on one, which would never have found anything.

# Where this library lives, resolved at source time: the digest manifest sits
# beside it, and a build-<tag>.sh runs from wherever the caller happens to be.
