# SHA-256 digests of the AOTriton release assets perfmon downloads.

# Format is sha256sum(1)'s, so a line can be checked directly:
#     grep ' <asset>$' asset_sha256.txt | sha256sum -c -
#
# Source: GitHub's release API reports a `digest` field per asset
# (`sha256:<hex>`), which is what the release page shows. Regenerate with
#     perfmon/scripts/lib/refresh_asset_sha256.sh > perfmon/scripts/lib/asset_sha256.txt
# Not fetched at build time on purpose: a digest fetched over the same
# connection as the file it vouches for checks that the download completed, not
# that it is the file this repo was tested against. Committing it makes the
# expected bytes reviewable, and a change to them show up in a diff.
#
# Every asset of every tag is listed, not just the ones the build scripts ask
# for today: the extra lines cost nothing, and a tag whose asset name changes
# should fail on the name rather than by falling through to "digest unknown".
#
# An asset with no entry here is a WARNING, not an error -- a new tag can be
# built before anyone records its digests. Add them here to make it enforced.
