# modules/flash/perfmon/runner/CMakeLists.txt (T12/T13), which both need the
# same answer to one question: which directories must be on an installed
# binary's RPATH for it to find ROCm's RUNTIME libraries?
#
# It is deliberately NOT "${ROCM_PATH}/lib".
#
# On theRock, ROCM_PATH points at the `_rocm_sdk_devel` Python package --
# headers, CMake config files, LLVM: everything needed to BUILD. The runtime
# libraries live in sibling packages:
#
#   _rocm_sdk_core       libamdhip64, libamd_comgr, libhsa-runtime64,
#                        libamd_smi, librocm_kpack, librocprofiler-register,
#                        and the private rocm_sysdeps/ + host-math/ copies
#   _rocm_sdk_libraries  the math libraries (rocblas, hipblaslt, ...)
#
# `_rocm_sdk_devel` also contains HARDLINKED copies of core's libraries --
# `libamdhip64.so.7` has a link count of 3 across the two packages. That is
# precisely what makes the bug invisible: RPATH entries pointing into devel
# resolve perfectly on a build host, and then fail on a deployment host that
# installed only core+libraries, where those paths do not exist at all. A
# perfmon runner is built once and shipped to measurement nodes, so that is
# the normal case, not an edge case.
#
# Classical ROCm (/opt/rocm) has no such split: build and runtime trees are
# the same one, and the fallback below handles it unchanged.

# perfmon_rocm_runtime_dirs(<out_var> <rocm_path>)
#
# Sets <out_var> in the caller's scope to a list of runtime library
# directories. Override wholesale with -DPERFMON_ROCM_RUNTIME_DIRS=... for a
# layout this does not recognize.
